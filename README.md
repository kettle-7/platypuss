A decentralised chat platform

The system is made of three main parts:
- the authentication server, which handles logging in and user profile data such as avatar picture and username
- the server, which is a place to post messages, upload images etc
- the client, which is an app or website that lets you send and read messages.

The idea is that people can host their own server, customise the server-side code with plugins, and then others can join their server with an unique username that is theirs across all servers, and the server owners never get to see their passwords.

much more will be coming here soon, after I add email verification I'll post instructions here on how to start hosting your own server.
