# Terms of Service

I would strongly reccommend reading this document, as it outlines a lot of
very important information and many websites will sneak whatever they want
in here and you won't notice, and then you'll be legally bound to those
terms. Anyway, I want to keep this short, sweet and easy to understand.

## Using this software

I'm not a company. I will not accept responsibility for anything that happens
as a result of your use or misuse of the software. You can use it, modify it,
share it, etc. under the terms of the
[GNU Public License V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). By using
the software you are saying that you agree to those terms. I believe in
open-source software, so the "reference" server and client are both open
sourced and available on GitHub. The usual common sense applies, don't say
that you made it (or anybody else except for me), don't try take me to court
if it doesn't work the way you want it to, but do tell me about any bugs
because I do actually want to fix them.

## I reserve the right to stop you from using the software:

- If you claim to have made it,
- If you are using it or trying to use it to harm other people or
- If you are attempting to exploit bugs in the software for malicious purposes.

## Data the software collects about you

When you use the website I do collect some neccessary data on you so that I
can make it actually work the way it should, this includes:
- Your e-mail address (for most accounts): I don't send you emails unless I
  have to because it's quite annoying to try and do. I don't have any reason
  to look at your email address either, it's stored safely in a database. The
  only reason I collect it at all is so that I can try to prevent people from
  making lots of accounts (you can just use another e-mail address but that's
  enough to deter most people). I don't share your e-mail address with anyone.
- Your password: I can't see your password. It's encrypted on the client side
  (in your browser before you click the Sign In button) so I can't actually
  see it, I can only see a jumble of letters that is generated that is nearly
  unique for each password, so that I can see if another password you enter
  is the same password. If I didn't collect it then you wouldn't be able to
  log into the same account twice. I don't share your password either.
- A list of servers you're in: This is collected so that the app can sync the
  servers you're in between devices, this just means you don't have to join
  the same server once for every device you log into. I don't share this list
  with anyone.
- Your profile picture (if you upload one): Anybody who shares a server with
  you can see your profile picture (it would suck if they couldn't) so I can
  only control to a certain degree how this is handled. I don't share them
  myself though.
- Your "about me" section (if you set one): Same goes as for the profile
  picture. I suggest not putting sensitive information here.
- Same again with files you upload to the website.

## Data server owners can collect

I can't control what server owners do with the data they get but I do know
basically what data they get and why they get it.
- The messages you send: So that they can send it to everybody else. This is
  seen by the server owner and usually everybody else in the server too. Don't
  share anything you're not confident sharing.
- Images you upload: Server owners can see this, usually everybody else on the
  server can as well. Again, don't share information you don't want shared.
- Your profile information: your profile picture (if you upload one), your
  username and your "about me" section are visible to everybody else who is in
  a server with you, including the owner of the server.

## Data they can't collect

- Your password: this is never shared with anyone.
- Your email address: this is never shared with anybody.
- The other servers you're in, this isn't shared with anybody else either.
